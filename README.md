# chicken_nest_surveillance
Using ESP32-cam with HC-SR04 to check if a chicken is sitting on the nest and if - sending photo to telegram chat. Photographing is blocked after first picture. So you get only one photo of the ckicken and not a continuous stream. After sonic sensor detected no chicken for 30 seconds, next chicken would be photographed again.
